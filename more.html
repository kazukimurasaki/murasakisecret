    <p>If you have made it this far, congratulations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You have fulfilled all requirements to access this reward.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Playing all the Blakeuza mods.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Playing the finale of the series: Murasaki Everywhere: Gensokyo Origins.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And reading all the stories till the end.</p>
    <p>Hajimari, Gensokyo Origins, Fleeting Youth, and Drink Links.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You have truly proven your dedication to Murasaki's story.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But more importantly...</p>
    <br>
    <p>You've made Murasaki's suffering finally heard.</p>
    <br>
    <p>He won't have to hold the pain by himself anymore.</p>
    <br>
    <p>His inner child can finally be at rest.</p>
    <p>He can finally put down the mask.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And maybe... Just maybe...</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>He can finally find purpose in himself.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>Just keep this question in the back of your mind<br>if you want to look back on Murasaki's journey across Gensokyo...</p>
